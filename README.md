HyperionDev - Little Sister's Vocabulary Project

This program helps individuals learn new words and their meanings by using a vocabulary builder that interacts with the user through text-based input and output. From the use of given words or inputs the indivdual will learn to create new words by adding and removing prefixes and suffiexes to the beginning or end of words.

USAGE

Function 1 - Adds a prefix to a word. It prompts the user to enter a word and to enter a prefix to create a new word. The function then asks the user to enter another word and prefix. 

Function 2 - Removes a suffix from a word. It prompts the user to enter a word that ends in 'ness', it then removes the suffix to create a new word. The program then prompts the user to enter another word. In the case where the base word originally ended in a consonant followed by the letter 'y', the 'y' was replaced with 'i'. To revert back to the original form, removing the suffix '-ness' should bring back the 'y' in those base words. For example, 'happiness' becomes 'happi' and then reverts to 'happy' when the '-ness' is removed.
